# Project 4 - AngularJS Mars Colony Safety App

## Project Summary
A single page reporting app for Martian Colonists to report alien encounters and actions taken when dealing with the aliens. Using Ajax GET and POST API's, the App records user information when logged in; displays encounter reports from other colonists; and can file a new report whenever an alien is encountered. Using CSS animations and Angular ng-animate to transition between pages added a nice polish to this app.

## Tools Used
- HTML/CSS/SASS
- AngularJS
- Ajax GET and POST requests
- CSS keyframe animations

## Experiences
Like with any new language, learning it's syntax and how to use it's built-in functionality was the biggest challenge. With Angular, once I had a solid grasp on it's specific syntax and the differences between elements such as a Factory and Service, I found Angular surprisingly easy to write and understand. I have to say the great documentation for Angular was an excellent resource and helped explain concepts that enabled me to feel comfortable with this framework.
